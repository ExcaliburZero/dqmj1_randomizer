# Release
The following is the process for creating a new release of DQMJ1 Unofficial Randomizer.

## Instructions
* Update the screenshot in the readme
* Choose a new `vX.Y.Z` version number that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
* Update the version number in the following locations:
    * `pyproject.toml`
    * `CHANGELOG.md`
* Make a commit with a message like: `Update version to vX.Y.Z`
* Create an annotated tag
```bash
export VERSION=vX.Y.Z

git tag -a $Version -m "$VERSION"
git push origin $VERSION
```
* Push the new commit
```bash
git push origin master
```
* Wait for the GitHub Actions build of `master` branch to finish
    * NOT the GitHub Actions build of the `vX.Y.Z` tag, since that will not generate artifacts with the correct version naming
* Create a [new release](https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/dqmj1_randomizer/releases/new) on GitHub
    * Use the tag you created
    * Set the release title to be `vX.Y.Z`
    * Copy paste the relevant lines from `CHANGELOG.md`
    * Download the Windows and Linux executables generated by GitHub Actions
    * Upload the Windows and Linux executables to the release
